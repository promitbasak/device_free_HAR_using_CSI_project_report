ABSTRACT={Recognizing human activities from video sequences or still images is a challenging task due to problems, such as background clutter, partial occlusion, changes in scale, viewpoint, lighting, and appearance. Many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances in the field of human activity classification. We propose a categorization of human activity methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide human activity classification methods into two large categories according to whether they use data from different modalities or not. Then, each of these categories is further analyzed into sub-categories, which reflect how they model human activities and what type of activities they are interested in. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing, publicly available human activity classification datasets and examine the requirements for an ideal human activity recognition dataset. Finally, we report the characteristics of future research directions and present some open issues on human activity recognition.}

ABSTRACT = {In view of its important application value, background modeling is studied so widely that many techniques have emerged, which mainly concentrate on the selections of the basic model, the granularity of processing, the components in a framework, etc. However, the quality of samples (QoS) for training has long been ignored. There are two aspects regarding this issue, which are how many samples are suitable and which samples are reliable. To tackle the &ldquo;how many&rdquo; problem, in this paper, we propose a convergent method, coined Bi-Variance (BV), to decide an appropriate endpoint in the training sequence. In this way, samples in the range from the first frame to the endpoint can be used for model establishment, rather than using all the samples. With respect to the &ldquo;which&rdquo; problem, we construct a pixel histogram for each pixel and subtract one from each bin (called number of intensity values (NoIV-1)), which can efficiently get rid of outliers. Furthermore, our work is plug-and-play in nature, so that it could be applied to diverse sample-based background subtraction methods. In experiments, we integrate our scheme into several state-of-the-art methods, and the results show that the performance of these methods in three indicators, recall, precision, and F-measure, improved from 4.95% to 16.47%, from 5.39% to 26.54%, and from 12.46% to 20.46%, respectively.},
